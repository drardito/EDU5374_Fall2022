The goal of this second part is to get us set up to make our first two Reading/Viewing/Observing journal entries and participate in our first Mattermost discussion.

### Reading/Viewing/Observing Journal Entries #1 and #2

Most weeks, you will be asked to engage with texts of various kinds – articles, videos, podcasts, etc. – and then respond to them in what I call your Reading/Viewing/Observing Journals.

Here are [the requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FAeyqz-d2RzNeODOFpCVcJop_QO_4sRMwTKLnmu9dc0/edit?usp=sharing) for this assignment. Here is the [assessment rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10VTcIZ45QV5yI3qUDu0mmr5uYkt0_G58xmG1lBfw6fM/edit?usp=sharing) I will be using to evaluate your work. And here is a [sample entry](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dctBjmVVvoy56ybtY0oBsFRAFEKA_GgC1tJmzu082vg/edit?usp=sharing). Please look over the requirements and let me know if you have any questions.

i ask that you create one journal for the entire semester, to which you will add the weekly entries. You can do this in two ways. You can create and share a Google Doc with me (use arditog@mville), and be sure to give me editing privileges. Or you can create and share an Office 365 doc with me (use gerald.ardito@mville), and be sure to give me editing privileges.

Here are the two *texts* for this first week:

1. Lombardi, Paula (n.d.). [Instructional Methods, Strategies and Technologies to Meet the Needs of All Learners](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZlrNdlDBAtPn-WXWWzNFUKLIvSADWXAq/view?usp=sharing). Chapter 2, Surface and Deep Learning.
2. Klein, Ezra (2022). Ezra Klein Show Podcast episode, [A Life-Changing Philosophy of Games](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS84MkZJMzVQeA/episode/M2QwMmFmY2UtODIzYS00YmFiLWE3ODktNTBjMWY4Y2JjYmE1?sa=X&ved=0CAUQkfYCahgKEwjAwdXXiPr5AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQ0QI).

### Mattermost Guiding Question #1

For this first week, the Guiding Question is: 

*What do we know and what do we think we know about adolescents and how they learn?***

You will post your responses in the *Guiding Question #1* Channel. I ask and expect that you will participate actively and substantively in this discussion by interacting with your classmates regularly.

#### This work is due no later than the end of the day on Monday, September 12.
