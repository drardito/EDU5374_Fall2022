This week we are continuing our work on Curriculum Design. We will revisit the power of Essential Questions and Big Ideas/Enduring Understandings, and learn to effectively read Learning Standards documents.

### Understanding By Design

![](http://amywarms.weebly.com/uploads/2/7/9/5/27953221/6464429_orig.jpg)

As we have said, Understanding By Design (UbD) is a framework for curriculum design created by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe. This framework is organized around starting with the end point in mind (how will you know that your students have engaged powerfully and effectively with what is fundamental about the topics at hand), and then building and orchestrating learning experiences that lead to the end point.

This week we will continue to develop our understanding of the UbD framework, especially those components that focus on ***establishing priorities*** -- *Essential Questions*, *Big Ideas/Enduring Understanding* and reading *Learning Standards* documents.

#### My Introduction to Establishing Priorities
I have put together a brief video which introduces you to these components of ***establishing priorities***. The most important part of this video is the section about how to effectively read Learning Standards documents.

And here, for reference, is the slideshow I put together for this video.

#### Reading - UbD - Esablishing Priorities - Crafting Essential Questions and Big Ideas
Please read these chapters from the UbD book, which you can download as a PDF [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AxEYcEmxcEBWdfU_X3-j756_kUbb0tJF/view?usp=sharing).

* Chapter 5 - Essential Questions: Doorways to Understanding
* Chapter 6 - Crafting Understandings

I strongly suggest that you take notes for yourself as you read these chapters. However, you **do not** need to create any new journal entries.

#### Reading - Learning Standards Documents for Your Content Area
Now that you have more of a sense by which we mean by crafting Essential Questions and Big Ideas/Enduring Understandings, it is time to get familiar with the Learning Standards document(s) for your content areas.

I have put together [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fMlPk0XtqdlMBuLoZvffU3ki_9qXOAoFS5PNWiy6vOo/edit?usp=sharing) with links to the learning standards for your content areas. Your job is to read them as I mentioned in the video to get a sense of the principles used in their design, their structure, and the specifics of the learning standards pertaining to the unit you are in the midst of designing.

Here's what to do:

1. **Find the Learning Standards document(s) for the unit you are designing.** You can use the document I linked to above.  
2. **Get a sense of how this document is structured.** What was the context of its design? Who was involved? What principles does it consider important?  
3. **Identify  the standards that apply to the topic for the grade level at which you are designing a unit in this class.** List these in the Unit Planning worksheet that you have been working on.
4. **Create a Journal Entry.** Now that you have done a deep dive into the Learning Standards document for your content area and topic, please create a journal entry that reflects on the process of doing so, any insights you have developed from this work, and your overall impressions of the learning standards documents themselves.

### Mattermost - Guiding Question #10

For this week (Week 10), the Guiding Question is: 

*What has been your experience dealing with learning standards so far in your experiences as a teacher/teacher candidate? After reviewing the document(s) in your content area, what sticks out to you? What questions or wonderings do you have?*

You will post your responses in the [Guiding Question #10 Channel](https://gardito-mattermost.us.reclaim.cloud/coursework/channels/guiding-question-10).

I continue ask and expect that you will continue to participate actively and substantively in this discussion by interacting with your classmates regularly.

#### This work is due no later than the end of the day on Monday, November 14.
