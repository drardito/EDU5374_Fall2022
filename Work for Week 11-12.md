This week we are continuing our work on Curriculum Design. Now that we have established priorities through Essential Questions, Big Ideas/Enduring Understandings, and reviewing Learning Standards, we are going to work on how to determine acceptable evidence for learning through the design of what McTighe and Wiggins call [Performance Tasks](https://jaymctighe.com/category/performance-tasks/).

### Understanding By Design - Performance Tasks

![](http://amywarms.weebly.com/uploads/2/7/9/5/27953221/6464429_orig.jpg)

As we have said, Understanding By Design (UbD) is a framework for curriculum design created by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe. This framework is organized around starting with the end point in mind (how will you know that your students have engaged powerfully and effectively with what is fundamental about the topics at hand), and then building and orchestrating learning experiences that lead to the end point.

This week we will continue to develop our understanding of the UbD framework, especially those components that focus on ***determining acceptable evidence (stage two***) through the design of ***performance tasks***.

#### My Introduction to Performance
I have put together a brief video which introduces you to these components of ***performance tasks.*** My focus is to put this skill into the larger context of the course.

And here, for reference, is the slideshow I put together for this video.

#### Reading - UbD - Determining Acceptable Evidence 
Please read these chapters from the UbD book, which you can download as a PDF [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AxEYcEmxcEBWdfU_X3-j756_kUbb0tJF/view?usp=sharing).

* Chapter 7 - Thinking Like an Assessor
* Chapter 8 - Criteria and Validity

I strongly suggest that you take notes for yourself as you read these chapters. However, you **do not** need to create any new journal entries.

#### Drafting Some Possible Performance Tasks
Now that you have more of a sense by which we mean by creating Performance Tasks, it is time to get try your hand at building some.

McTighe and Wiggins have put together [this document](https://grantwiggins.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/wiggins-mod-m-grasps-and-roles.pdf) with examples of performance tasks in various content areas at various levels. This may serve to start your thinking about possible performance tasks for hte unit are building. have put together [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fMlPk0XtqdlMBuLoZvffU3ki_9qXOAoFS5PNWiy6vOo/edit?usp=sharing) with links to the learning standards for your content areas. Your job is to read them as I mentioned in the video to get a sense of the principles used in their design, their structure, and the specifics of the learning standards pertaining to the unit you are in the midst of designing.

Here's what to do:

1. **Learn about Performance Tasks from the textbook and sample document** Challenge yourself to think through the process.
2. **Come up with ideas (and descriptions) for at least three possible performance tasks for the unit you are building**. For each, use the **G.R.A.S.P.S.** framework that McTighe and Wiggins suggest. 
4. **Create a Journal Entry.** Now that you have done ideas for possible performance tasks for your unit, please create a journal entry shares these ideas along with a reflection of what that experience was like for you.

### Mattermost - Guiding Question #11

For this week (Week 11), the Guiding Question is: 

*How do you know when you have learned something whether you have learned it insider or outside of formal learning settings? What projects and/or other performance tasks do you remember most from your time in schools?*

You will post your responses in the [Guiding Question #11 Channel](https://gardito-mattermost.us.reclaim.cloud/coursework/channels/guiding-question-11).

I continue ask and expect that you will continue to participate actively and substantively in this discussion by interacting with your classmates regularly.

### Accelerated Work - Final Unit Plan

If you wish, you can get started on your  Final Unit Plan, which I was planning to assign for Week 12. 

[Here is the Unit Plan template as a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-oxAvdALulqOKrBXtMelElaWAimzKtBfKoM8WxPAYMk/edit?usp=sharing). To use it, go to File>Make a Copy. Then rename it to include Your Name and EDU 3024 or EDU 5374. Lastly, share it with me via arditog@mville, and include editing privileges.

[Here is the Unit Plan template as an Office 365 document](https://manhattanville-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/gerald_ardito_mville_edu/EZ1fOv_wGmZLus02O_blTzkBXe_fIepvLoXCgTobGgNRrg?e=Vu1Ybn). To use it, go to Save As, then rename it to include Your Name and EDU 3024 or EDU 5374. Lastly, share it with me via gerald.ardito@mville.edu, and include editing privileges.

Here is a video walkthrough of the template. I strong suggest viewing it before you start working on your final Unit Plan.
