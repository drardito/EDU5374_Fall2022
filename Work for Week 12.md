This week we are wrapping up our work on designing a fullly baked Unit Plan. 

#### Previously on Unit Planning
So far, you have:  
1. **Identified a set of topics** that comprise a meaningful unit of study for adolescent students.
2. **Created Essential Questions and Big Ideas/Enduring Understandings** for your unit. This is all about thinking through what's most important/fundmental and helps focus the planning you are doing.
3. **Created a Concept Map of your topic**. Concept mapping, as you likely now know is a powerful tool for make understanding visible and identifying the connections between key ideas.
4. **Identified Learning Standards** in your topc from the appropriate learning standards documents. This is another way of establishing priorities and understanding the bigger picture of what you are teaching.
5. **Created a flow of concepts**. You have thought through the logical flow of topics and sub-topics in your unit.
6. **Brainstormed possible Performance Tasks** for your unit. In this way, you are determining how you students will show you what they know at the end of the unit.

Good for you!

#### What's Next? The Final Unit Plan

Now, we need to complete the unit plan by adding the instructional context, theoretical basis for the learning strategies you plan to utilize, identify the disciplinary rationale, and how we will differentiate the unit for students with various needs and challenges.  

Your task, then, is to complete the final Unit Plan. To do this, you will transfer the work you have done on the worksheet so far into the formal Unit Planning template.

[Here is the Unit Plan template as a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-oxAvdALulqOKrBXtMelElaWAimzKtBfKoM8WxPAYMk/edit?usp=sharing). To use it, go to File>Make a Copy. Then rename it to include Your Name and EDU 3024 or EDU 5374. Lastly, share it with me via arditog@mville, and include editing privileges.

[Here is the Unit Plan template as an Office 365 document](https://manhattanville-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/gerald_ardito_mville_edu/EZ1fOv_wGmZLus02O_blTzkBXe_fIepvLoXCgTobGgNRrg?e=Vu1Ybn). To use it, go to Save As, then rename it to include Your Name and EDU 3024 or EDU 5374. Lastly, share it with me via gerald.ardito@mville.edu, and include editing privileges.

Here is a video walkthrough of the template. I strong suggest viewing it before you start working on your final Unit Plan.
