This week we are continuing our curriculum design work by transitioning from units into lessons.

## Previously on Curriculum Design

So far, you have:  

1. **Identified a set of topics** that comprise a meaningful unit of study for adolescent students.
2. **Created Essential Questions and Big Ideas/Enduring Understandings** for your unit. This is all about thinking through what's most important/fundamental and helps focus the planning you are doing.
3. **Created a Concept Map of your topic**. Concept mapping, as you likely now know is a powerful tool for make understanding visible and identifying the connections between key ideas.
4. **Identified Learning Standards** in your topc from the appropriate learning standards documents. This is another way of establishing priorities and understanding the bigger picture of what you are teaching.
5. **Created a flow of concepts**. You have thought through the logical flow of topics and sub-topics in your unit.
6. **Brainstormed possible Performance Tasks** for your unit. In this way, you are determining how you students will show you what they know at the end of the unit.
7. **Created a Final Unit Plan**. You have now created (for many of you for the first time) a full unit plan.

Good for you!

## What's Next? Developing Three Lesson Plans for Your Unit

<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1571195555904-f0fe9968ee5f?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=735&q=80" style="zoom:67%;" />

Now that you have completed the design of a full lesson plan, it is time to bring parts of your unit to life through the development of three full lesson plans. 


### Understanding by Design (UbD) and Lesson Planning
To help us move forward in designing lesson plans, we will return to our old friend, the **Understanding by Design (UbD) Framework**.

Please read these chapters from the UbD book, which you can download as a PDF [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AxEYcEmxcEBWdfU_X3-j756_kUbb0tJF/view?usp=sharing).

* Chapter 9 - Planning for Learning
* Chapter 10 - Teaching for Understanding

I strongly suggest that you take notes for yourself as you read these chapters. However, you **do not** need to create any new journal entries.

### Pedagogical Strategies for Your Lesson Plans
Our other textbook, [Instructional Methods, Strategies and Technologies to Meet the Needs of All Learners](https://granite.pressbooks.pub/teachingdiverselearners/), will be very useful as you work on your lesson plans. Here are some chapters that will be especially useful as you do this work.  

* Chapter 4 - [Direct Instruction](https://granite.pressbooks.pub/teachingdiverselearners/chapter/direct-instruction/)
* Chapter 7 - [Cooperative Learning](https://granite.pressbooks.pub/teachingdiverselearners/chapter/cooperative-learning-2/)
* Chapter 9 - [Questioning](https://granite.pressbooks.pub/teachingdiverselearners/chapter/questioning-2/)
* Chapter 12 - [Differentiated Instruction](https://granite.pressbooks.pub/teachingdiverselearners/chapter/differentiated-instruction-2/)
* Chapter 21 - [Learning with Digital Tools](https://granite.pressbooks.pub/teachingdiverselearners/chapter/learning-with-digital-tools-2/)

I am not expecting you to read each of these chapters. However, I firmly believe that you will find them useful as your work on your lesson plans.

I strongly suggest that you take notes for yourself as you read these chapters. However, you **do not** need to create any new journal entries.

### Design Your First Lesson Plan

As I have said elsewhere, you will be designing a total of 3 lesson plans from your unit. They will each have a specific focus area. These focus areas are:  
1. Using technology to enhance learning
2. Using discussions (whole group and/or small group) to enhance learning.
3. Using collaborative work to enhance learning.

***For this week, please build the lesson plan that focuses on using technology to enhance learning***.

[Here is the Lesson Plan template as a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z-9qYyOjULoRioue2CM0cqxmH7iHqoXvYoJa0-fAsEA/edit?usp=sharing). To use it, go to File>Make a Copy. Then rename it to include Your Name and EDU 3024 or EDU 5374. Lastly, share it with me via arditog@mville, and include editing privileges.

[Here is the Lesson Plan template as an Office 365 document](https://manhattanville-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/gerald_ardito_mville_edu/EYcIzdtUh0VBvK80pl1IwUsBRa-q-XV4SF_5h67YeIh9ig?e=MTxV3A). To use it, go to Save As, then rename it to include Your Name and EDU 3024 or EDU 5374. Lastly, share it with me via gerald.ardito@mville.edu, and include editing privileges.

Here is a video walkthrough of the Lesson Plan template. I strong suggest viewing it before you start working on your first Lesson Plan.

### Mattermost - Guiding Question #13

For this week (Week 13), the Guiding Question is: 

*From your own experiences as teachers and learners, what do you consider to be the most important things that lessons should try to accomplish? Please discuss in both academic terms as well as social-emotional-cogntive terms.*

You will post your responses in the [Guiding Question #13 Channel](https://gardito-mattermost.us.reclaim.cloud/coursework/channels/guiding-question-13).

I continue ask and expect that you will continue to participate actively and substantively in this discussion by interacting with your classmates regularly.
