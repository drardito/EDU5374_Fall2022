# Week 14: The Home Stretch - Final Lesson Plans and Fieldwork Work
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xhPU50g.jpeg" style="zoom:67%;" />

This week we are finalizing our work for the course, including final lesson plans and fieldwork logs and reflections. It is indeed the home stretch.

## Previously on Curriculum Design

So far, you have:  

1. **Identified a set of topics** that comprise a meaningful unit of study for adolescent students.
2. **Created Essential Questions and Big Ideas/Enduring Understandings** for your unit. This is all about thinking through what's most important/fundamental and helps focus the planning you are doing.
3. **Created a Concept Map of your topic**. Concept mapping, as you likely now know is a powerful tool for make understanding visible and identifying the connections between key ideas.
4. **Identified Learning Standards** in your topc from the appropriate learning standards documents. This is another way of establishing priorities and understanding the bigger picture of what you are teaching.
5. **Created a flow of concepts**. You have thought through the logical flow of topics and sub-topics in your unit.
6. **Brainstormed possible Performance Tasks** for your unit. In this way, you are determining how you students will show you what they know at the end of the unit.
7. **Created a Final Unit Plan**. You have now created (for many of you for the first time) a full unit plan.
8. **Created your first Lesson Plan**. You have create your first (of three) full lesson plans using the Mville lesson planning template.

Good for you!

## What's Next/Last? Developing  the Last Two Lesson Plans for Your Unit

Now that you have completed the design of your first full lesson plan, you will do the work to complete the development of the final two lesson plans.


### Lesson Planning Resources

#### Understanding by Design (UbD)

As I mentioned in the work for Week 13, you can refer to these two chapters from the **Understanding by Design** book to support the work of designing these lesson plans.  

* Chapter 9 - Planning for Learning
* Chapter 10 - Teaching for Understanding

You can find these chapters in the UbD book, which you can download as a PDF [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AxEYcEmxcEBWdfU_X3-j756_kUbb0tJF/view?usp=sharing).

#### Pedagogical Strategies for Your Lesson Plans

As I also mentioned last week, our other textbook, [Instructional Methods, Strategies and Technologies to Meet the Needs of All Learners](https://granite.pressbooks.pub/teachingdiverselearners/), will be very useful as you work on your lesson plans. Here are some chapters that will be especially useful as you do this work.  

* Chapter 4 - [Direct Instruction](https://granite.pressbooks.pub/teachingdiverselearners/chapter/direct-instruction/)
* Chapter 7 - [Cooperative Learning](https://granite.pressbooks.pub/teachingdiverselearners/chapter/cooperative-learning-2/)
* Chapter 9 - [Questioning](https://granite.pressbooks.pub/teachingdiverselearners/chapter/questioning-2/)
* Chapter 12 - [Differentiated Instruction](https://granite.pressbooks.pub/teachingdiverselearners/chapter/differentiated-instruction-2/)
* Chapter 21 - [Learning with Digital Tools](https://granite.pressbooks.pub/teachingdiverselearners/chapter/learning-with-digital-tools-2/)

### Design Your Last Two Lesson Plans

As I have said elsewhere, you will be designing a total of 3 lesson plans from your unit. They will each have a specific focus area. These focus areas are:  
1. Using technology to enhance learning
2. Using discussions (whole group and/or small group) to enhance learning.
3. Using collaborative work to enhance learning.

For this week, please build the lesson plans that focus on using **discussions** and **collaborative work** to enhance learning. 

**You can either create separate collaborative documents for each of these lesson plans OR combine them all into one document (the one you have already shared with me).**

[Here is the Lesson Plan template as a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z-9qYyOjULoRioue2CM0cqxmH7iHqoXvYoJa0-fAsEA/edit?usp=sharing). To use it, go to File>Make a Copy. Then rename it to include Your Name and EDU 3024 or EDU 5374. Lastly, share it with me via arditog@mville, and include editing privileges.

[Here is the Lesson Plan template as an Office 365 document](https://manhattanville-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/gerald_ardito_mville_edu/EYcIzdtUh0VBvK80pl1IwUsBRa-q-XV4SF_5h67YeIh9ig?e=MTxV3A). To use it, go to Save As, then rename it to include Your Name and EDU 3024 or EDU 5374. Lastly, share it with me via gerald.ardito@mville.edu, and include editing privileges.

## Final Fieldwork Work

This week, as I mentioned in a recent email, you are also going to finish up your fieldwork work this week.  Here are the details:  

1. **Fieldwork Log**. As I have said before (and is in the syllabus) you must complete 18 hours of fieldwork as part of this course. These fieldwork hours must occur in real schools with real students, although it can be done in person or remotely. You will need to complete [this log](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Ffile%2Fd%2F1uyZPmzNE2GzF2OiEyC71rMJ4f8kH72M-%2Fview%3Fusp%3Dshare_link&data=05%7C01%7CGerald.Ardito%40mville.edu%7Ce4fbf1c847264e892ad808dad3f3363c%7C8eef84b9583f4f089f00f0608b9bb440%7C1%7C0%7C638055338795169684%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=fm965GUl6a%2BZoS0kZcy2KBB9peOyi9yA%2BwTyglq1nAs%3D&reserved=0) (along with the appropriate signatures) to meet this requirement.  Please email it to me as PDF and not as an image file.  

2. **Fieldwork Reflection**. When your observations are completed, write a 5-7 page reflection of your visits.  You should focus on making connections between your fieldwork experiences, key course readings, and class discussions in this reflection. You do not need to address every reading or discussion. Instead, you will decide which of these are the most important/relevant to you and what you observed in the classrooms you visited. Be sure to include citations to the readings. ***This reflection should be the final entry in your journal***.

## Mattermost - Guiding Question #14

For this week (Week 14), the Guiding Question is: 

*What are walking away with from this course? How are you now thinking about teaching adolescents and engaging them in experiences of your design that lead to deep learning? Where will you go next in terms of your development as a teacher?*

You will post your responses in the [Guiding Question #14 Channel](https://gardito-mattermost.us.reclaim.cloud/coursework/channels/guiding-questions-14).

I continue ask and expect that you will continue to participate actively and substantively in this discussion by interacting with your classmates regularly.

***ALL of this work is due no later than the end of the day on Monday, December  12.***
