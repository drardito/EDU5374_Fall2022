Here is the work for Week 2. Our goal this week, in keeping with what you read about Surface and Deep Learning, is to increase the depth of our understanding of the design of learning environments.

### Reading/Viewing/Observing Journal Entries #3 and #4

Most weeks, you will be asked to engage with texts of various kinds – articles, videos, podcasts, etc. – and then respond to them in what I call your Reading/Viewing/Observing Journals.

As a reminder – Here are [the requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FAeyqz-d2RzNeODOFpCVcJop_QO_4sRMwTKLnmu9dc0/edit?usp=sharing) for this assignment. Here is the [assessment rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10VTcIZ45QV5yI3qUDu0mmr5uYkt0_G58xmG1lBfw6fM/edit?usp=sharing) I will be using to evaluate your work. And here is a [sample entry](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dctBjmVVvoy56ybtY0oBsFRAFEKA_GgC1tJmzu082vg/edit?usp=sharing). Please look over the requirements and let me know if you have any questions.

i ask that you create one journal for the entire semester, to which you will add the weekly entries. You will add these entries to the journal you set up in Week 1.

Also be sure to look at the feedback I will leave on your first two journal entries. 

Here are the  *texts* for this week. One is another chapter from the Lombardi book. The other two are research papers focused on learning environments. Everyone should read the book chapter, and you can choose at least one of the two papers (feel free to read both but you are only required to read one).

1. Lombardi, Paula (n.d.). [Instructional Methods, Strategies and Technologies to Meet the Needs of All Learners](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZlrNdlDBAtPn-WXWWzNFUKLIvSADWXAq/view?usp=sharing). Chapter 13: Universal Design for Learning..
2. Ardito, G. (2018). [*Emerging student learning networks: self-directed learning in an eighth-grade life science classroom*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rl_t11vKrOi5tZzfryjGyOvgD55V46yZ/view?usp=sharing). Issues and Trends in Educational Technology, 6(2).
3. Dron, J. (2016). [p-Learning’s unwelcome legacy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DL80IVzSm5AmbxQk_UbQH_bGDWRxLbOk/view?usp=sharing). Italian Journal of Educational Technology, 24(2), 72-72.

### Mattermost Guiding Question #2

For this week (Week 2), the Guiding Question is: 

*How have you seen adolescents respond positively or negatively to the learning environments created by their teachers? Be as specific as you can.*

You will post your responses in the [Guiding Question #2 Channel](https://gardito-mattermost.us.reclaim.cloud/coursework/channels/guiding-question-2).

I ask and expect that you will participate actively and substantively in this discussion by interacting with your classmates regularly.
