Here is the work for Week 3. Over the past two weeks, our Mattermost discussions have touched over and over again on student agency and autonomy. So, this week, we will begin our exploration of [Self Determination Theory](https://selfdeterminationtheory.org), a powerful framework for understanding motivation and engagement. The short version is that the framework says that humans have three fundamental psychological needs: a need for autonomy, and need for competence, and a need for relatedness. When these needs are fulfilled, humans experience high levels of engagement and intrinsic motivation. There has been a great deal of research into this framework and its implications for [educational settings](https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/topics/application-education/). You will be doing some reading about this this week.

### Reading/Viewing/Observing Journal Entries #5 and #6

Most weeks, you will be asked to engage with texts of various kinds – articles, videos, podcasts, etc. – and then respond to them in what I call your Reading/Viewing/Observing Journals.

As a reminder – Here are [the requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FAeyqz-d2RzNeODOFpCVcJop_QO_4sRMwTKLnmu9dc0/edit?usp=sharing) for this assignment. Here is the [assessment rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10VTcIZ45QV5yI3qUDu0mmr5uYkt0_G58xmG1lBfw6fM/edit?usp=sharing) I will be using to evaluate your work. And here is a [sample entry](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dctBjmVVvoy56ybtY0oBsFRAFEKA_GgC1tJmzu082vg/edit?usp=sharing). Please look over the requirements and let me know if you have any questions.

Please continue to add the current entries to the journal you have already created.

Here are the  *texts* for this week. These are both research articles focused on Self Determination Theory (SDT) in educational settings. The first is written by the founders of the framework (Ryan & Deci), and the second is co-written by the researcher (Reeve) who has focused the most on applying SDT in education. They are slightly longer than the articles we have been reading, and are a little bit denser, so please plan accordingly.

1. Ryan, R. M., & Deci, E. L. (2020). [Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation from a self-determination theory perspective: Definitions, theory, practices, and future directions](https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2020_RyanDeci_IntrinsicandExtrinsic.pdf). *Contemporary educational psychology*, 61,101860.
2. Reeve, J., & Cheon, S. H. (2021). [Autonomy-supportive teaching: Its malleability, benefits, and potential to improve educational practice](https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021_ReeveCheon_AutonomySupportive.pdf). *Educational Psychologist*, 56(1), 54-77.

### Mattermost Guiding Question #3

For this week (Week 3), the Guiding Question is: 

*What roles do trust, respect, and autonomy/agency play in a learning environment? How have you or how have you seen other teachers orchestrate these things (either well or badly)?.*

You will post your responses in the [Guiding Question #3 Channel](https://gardito-mattermost.us.reclaim.cloud/coursework/channels/guiding-question-3).

I continue ask and expect that you will participate actively and substantively in this discussion by interacting with your classmates regularly.
