Here is the work for Week 4. For the the past two weeks, you have been very powerfully engaged - by the readings and our Mattermost discussions - in issues of autonomy and trust and the learning environment. This week, we turn our attention to [Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load), which seeks to understand and explain how learners process information and thus learn. You will be doing some reading about CLT this week. As you do this reading, please think about the areas of your content areas that are more *concrete* and those that are more *abstract*, and how they are related to one another.

### Reading/Viewing/Observing Journal Entries #7 and #8

This week, just like in past weeks, you will be asked to engage with texts of various kinds – articles, videos, podcasts, etc. – and then respond to them in what I call your Reading/Viewing/Observing Journals.

As a reminder – Here are [the requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FAeyqz-d2RzNeODOFpCVcJop_QO_4sRMwTKLnmu9dc0/edit?usp=sharing) for this assignment. Here is the [assessment rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10VTcIZ45QV5yI3qUDu0mmr5uYkt0_G58xmG1lBfw6fM/edit?usp=sharing) I will be using to evaluate your work. And here is a [sample entry](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dctBjmVVvoy56ybtY0oBsFRAFEKA_GgC1tJmzu082vg/edit?usp=sharing). Please look over the requirements and let me know if you have any questions.

Please continue to add the current entries to the journal you have already created.

Here are the  *texts* for this week. Both will introduce you to [Cognitive Load Theory(CLT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load), which seeks to understand how the brain's architecture for information processing affects learning and teaching. The first provides a review of CLT for teachers. The second is a practical guide on CLT for teachers in New South Wales.

### Mattermost Guiding Question #4

For this week (Week 4), the Guiding Question is: 

*In each of our content areas, and within pretty much every topic, there are levels of concepts that are more concrete and those that are more abstract. How have you seen teachers (yourself included) orchestrate and/or layer these levels of abstractness and concreteness in order to support student learning.*

You will post your responses in the [Guiding Question #4 Channel](https://gardito-mattermost.us.reclaim.cloud/coursework/channels/guiding-question-4).

I continue ask and expect that you will participate actively and substantively in this discussion by interacting with your classmates regularly.
