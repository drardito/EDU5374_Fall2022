For the past few weeks, we have been engaged in issues of agency, autonomy, and trust. This week, we shift our focus to the role and impact of feedback in learning. Some have said, rightly I believe, that if there is no feedback there is no learning. Those of you who coach or have been coached I think understand this in very specific ways. 

As you engage yourself in feedback this week, please keep [Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load) in mind. I think you will see lots of connections between the two, especially as you read the Hattie paper. Please also keep in mind our discussion on Mattermost on orchestrating levels of concrete and abstract things in our teaching. 

Next week, we will start applying what we have been discussing into some micro-teaching.

### Reading/Viewing/Observing Journal Entries #9 and #10

Here is the [assessment rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10VTcIZ45QV5yI3qUDu0mmr5uYkt0_G58xmG1lBfw6fM/edit?usp=sharing) I will be using to evaluate your work. And here is a [sample entry](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dctBjmVVvoy56ybtY0oBsFRAFEKA_GgC1tJmzu082vg/edit?usp=sharing). Please look over the requirements and let me know if you have any questions.

Please continue to add the current entries to the journal you have already created.

Here are the  *texts* for this week. Both are focused on feedback and how learners are affected by it.

### Mattermost - Guiding Question #5

For this week (Week 5), the Guiding Question is: 

*What are the kinds of feedback you have received from teachers that has been the most beneficial to you and why? What are the kinds of feedback you have received from teachers that has been least beneficial to you and why?*

You will post your responses in the [Guiding Question #5 Channel](https://gardito-mattermost.us.reclaim.cloud/coursework/channels/guiding-question-5).

I continue ask and expect that you will continue to participate actively and substantively in this discussion by interacting with your classmates regularly.
