For the past few weeks, we have been exploring some key ideas that shape the teaching adolescents: learning environments, autonomy, engagement and motivation, and cognitive load. Now, we are going to turn our attention to what I call orchestrating levels of complexity, abstraction, and depth in our teaching. To do this, we are going to use [**Bloom's Taxonomy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy) as a way to talk about these levels and ways that we can design learning activities that allow students to access the full range of understanding. As part of this work, we will also explore [**concept mapping**](https://cmap.ihmc.us/docs/theory-of-concept-maps.php) as a tool for planning, teaching, and learning.

### Reading/Viewing/Observing Journal Entries #11 - 13

This week, just like in past weeks, you will be asked to engage with texts of various kinds – articles, videos, podcasts, etc. – and then respond to them in what I call your Reading/Viewing/Observing Journals.

As a reminder – Here are [the requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FAeyqz-d2RzNeODOFpCVcJop_QO_4sRMwTKLnmu9dc0/edit?usp=sharing) for this assignment. Here is the [assessment rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10VTcIZ45QV5yI3qUDu0mmr5uYkt0_G58xmG1lBfw6fM/edit?usp=sharing) I will be using to evaluate your work. And here is a [sample entry](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dctBjmVVvoy56ybtY0oBsFRAFEKA_GgC1tJmzu082vg/edit?usp=sharing). Please look over the requirements and let me know if you have any questions.

Please continue to add the current entries to the journal you have already created.

Here are the *texts* for this week. As you will see, we will be looking at [Bloom's Taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy) as a framework for talking about depth, complexity, and abstraction and [concept mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map) as a tool for making learning visible.

### Mattermost - Guiding Question #7

For this week (Week 7), the Guiding Question is: 

*What are some ways that you have seen teachers successfully or unsuccessful negotiate levels of complexity, depth, and abstraction with their students? If you are a teacher, what are some ways (again, successfully or not) that you have worked to do this?*

You will post your responses in the [Guiding Question #7 Channel](https://gardito-mattermost.us.reclaim.cloud/coursework/channels/guiding-question-7).

I continue ask and expect that you will continue to participate actively and substantively in this discussion by interacting with your classmates regularly.
