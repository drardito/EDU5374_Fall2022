For the bulk of the course so far, we have been engaging with some topics that I believe are core to teaching adolescents: learning environments, engagement and motivation, autonomy and agency, and feedback. Now, it's time for you to apply some of these via some *micro-teaching*. 

For our first *micro-teaching* experience, you will be designing and delivering a 3 to 5 minute video introduction to a core topic in your content area. Imagine yourself getting ready to teach a topic that would take 2-4 weeks of instruction/learning experiences. In this 3-5 minutes, you will be creating an introduction that communicates what you consider essential about this topic in a way that engages and perhaps even inspires your students.

You will create and share your video using a tool called Flip. Flip is a tool used in lots of classrooms. You will post your video to Flip by using [this link](https://flip.com/04184d30). You will first be asked to sign up for Flip, then you will be taken to this project. You will see a short video from me there talking about this assignment. Here is a (very) brief video that walks you through this process:

### Reading/Viewing/Observing Journal Entries - Fieldwork Reflection #1

This week you will have no new readings. Instead, you our focus for your journal will be to create an entry that focuses on your fieldwork experiences thus far in the course. 

For this assignment, you will write a **3-5 page reflection** that connects your fieldwork experiences for the semester thus far to some of the key ideas and discussions of the course up until now. As a reminder, here are some of these key ideas and discussions:  

1. Creating and nurturing learning environments.
2. Student engagement and motivation.
3. Cognitive Load Theory.
4. Student agency, autonomy, and self determination.
5. Feedback and it's role in learning.

You will choose which of these key ideas you will address in this reflection. As usual, I expect your work to be thorough, thoughtful, and substantive.

### Mattermost - Guiding Question #8

For this week's Mattermost discussion, I am going to ask you for some feedback on our course so far.

*How has this course been going for you so far? What have been working especially well for you? What suggestions do you have for improving it?*

You will post your responses in the [Guiding Question #8 Channel](https://gardito-mattermost.us.reclaim.cloud/coursework/channels/guiding-question-8).

I continue ask and expect that you will continue to participate actively and substantively in this discussion by interacting with your classmates regularly.
