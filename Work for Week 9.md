This week begins in earnest our deep work in designing curricular plans that engage students in deep learning. To do so, we will dive into the classic text and curriculum design framework called Understanding By Design.

### Understanding By Design

Understanding By Design (UbD) is a framework for curriculum design created by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe. This framework is organized around starting with the end point in mind (how will you know that your students have engaged powerfully and effectively with what is fundamental about the topics at hand), and then building and orchestrating learning experiences that lead to the end point.

What follows is a pathway to have you engage deeply in UbD.

#### Jay McTighe Introduces Understanding by Design
Please watch this video of Jay McTighe introducing UbD.

#### Introducing Yourself to UBD
Please read these chapters from the UbD book, which you can download as a PDF [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AxEYcEmxcEBWdfU_X3-j756_kUbb0tJF/view?usp=sharing).

* Chapter 1 - Backwards Design
* Chapter 2 - Understanding Understanding
* Chapter 3 - Gaining Clarity in Our Goals

I strongly suggest that you take notes for yourself as you read these chapters. However, you **do not** need to create any new journal entries.

### Beginning to Design a Unit
Now that you have a sense of what UbD is and how it works, you will begin to plan a unit of study. 
Here's what to do:

1. **Pick a unit** (think 2-4 weeks of instruction in your content area). Since you will be getting a great deal of feedback from me and your classmates about this work, I suggest that you choose a topic/unit that you are unfamiliar with and/or afraid of/intimidated by.

2. **Complete our UbD Unit Planning Worksheet** for the unit you are considering. You only need to complete the highlighted sections as a collaborative document in Google Docs or Office 365.

[Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vsCUI7fakpx_s5_t_JJwCLXlR397BstRzc2X98tA1TU/edit?usp=sharing)
Go to *File>Make a Copy*. Then share with me using arditog@mville.edu. Be sure to give me editing privileges as usual.

[Office 365 Document](https://manhattanville-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/gerald_ardito_mville_edu/EcZFHzd2vLxEscUD-6dnaF0BKtjJ60yyanrnP2cdIU6BiA?e=Z9Dok4):
Go to *File>Save As*. Then share it with me using gerald.ardito@mville.edu. Be sure to give me editing privileges as usual.

#### Concept Mapping Tools

As you will see, you will create a concept map of the key concepts and ideas from the unit you are planning to design. Here are a couple of good concept mapping tools:

1. [CmapTools](https://cmap.ihmc.us). You read about this tool last week. As you saw, it was designed by Joseph Nowak in response to his research into concept mapping and learning. This is the tool I primarily use for concept mapping and the one my students used in the study you read.
2. [XMind](https://xmind.app). I use this tool a great deal. You can make maps very quickly and effectively. 

There are plenty of other concept mapping tools freely available.

### Mattermost - Guiding Question #9

For this week (Week 9), the Guiding Question is: 

*What experience, if any, have you had in planning a unit of study? What do you already know about it? What questions do you have at this point about planning a unit of study? What do you think is the relationship between units and lessons?*

You will post your responses in the [Guiding Question #9 Channel](https://gardito-mattermost.us.reclaim.cloud/coursework/channels/guiding-question-9).

I continue ask and expect that you will continue to participate actively and substantively in this discussion by interacting with your classmates regularly.

#### This work is due no later than the end of the day on Monday, November 7.
